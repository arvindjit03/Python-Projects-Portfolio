We have done this Python project solely for learning purposes. We have used a medical dataset on which we have performed EDA and later used different Machine Learning models for the prediction of heart disease.

**Dataset**: This dataset is taken from Kaggle. According to the dataset, Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide.
Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure.

Columns/Features in the dataset:

- age                        
- anaemia                    
- creatinine_phosphokinase    
- diabetes                   
- ejection_fraction          
- high_blood_pressure       
- platelets                  
- serum_creatinine           
- serum_sodium               
- sex                        
- smoking                    
- time                      
- DEATH_EVENT
